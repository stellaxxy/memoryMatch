        <P class="mainParagraph">This memory match game is inspired by Monsters Inc, a Pixar's movie. All the characters and decorations are themed from the artwork of the movie. The rule is simple.
            In order to pass the game, you need to click on the gift boxes to see and memorize the characters hiding inside the box. When two of the characters matches, you have successfully find a pair, and
            they will stay on the screen. Otherwise, if the two characters are not the same, they will hide in the gift box again. I used JavaScript, jQuery, html and css to create this memory match game and
            make elements in the game more interactive to provide better user experience. </P>
